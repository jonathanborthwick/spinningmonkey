## PHP and scripts for spinningmonkey.com
---
Starting off with a reference folder that has initial attempts at reading an RSS file image tags and links, as well as code that will follow a link and attempt to get the first image.
The intention is to develop a plugin that will do this for me without having to have independent PHP files that rely on a third party plugin that lets you set a wordpress post image based off of a url to an image.
One of the scripts in the intial commit referece folder changes the header to that of an image and takes a url encoded parameter for the rss feed. 
After I have stabalized the code to get the image from the rss feed, or follow the rss feed link to get the thumbnail from the page itself, I want to develop code that will scan the RSS feed posts on demand and make draught posts from the auto-generated ones (the rss feed-powered ones).
